A set of innovations have been developed as a response to economic problems, emerging from changes in factor prices, profits, or obstacles to the rational production and use of goods. Second, there are innovations that have responded to environmental regulations and broader environmental problems stemming from negative externalities (cf Grübler, 2002 and Requate, 2005 ). These problems are labelled environmental problems, i.e. the negative effects of industrial production affecting a third party (other than the producer and consumer of a good). Third, one may distinguish innovations responding to demands pertaining to the work environment. These sets of problems have been labelled organizational problems, as they typically reflect intra-firm and broader social conflicts. A fourth category is “technological bottlenecks”, which refers to techno-economic obstacles to the exploitation of a new technology, product, market or some other opportunity. As opposed to bottlenecks in the production of goods (a production bottleneck), this refers thus to a bottleneck in the exploitation or development of a new technology."
