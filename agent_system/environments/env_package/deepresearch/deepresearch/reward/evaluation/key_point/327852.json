Instead of simply checking for a correct answer, teachers should emphasize the student's understanding and process they used to get the answer. 2. Recognition of the crucial role of children's self-initiated, active involvement in learning activities. In a Piagetian classroom, children are encourage to discover themselves through spontaneous interaction with the environment, rather than the presentation of ready-made knowledge. 3. A deemphasis on practices aimed at making children adult like in their thinking. This refers to what Piaget referred to as the \"American question\" which is \"How can we speed up development?\". His belief is that trying to speed up and accelerate children's process through the stages could be worse than no teaching at all. 4. Acceptance of individual differences in developmental progress. Piaget's theory asserts that children go through all the same developmental stages, however they do so at different rates. Because of this, teachers must make special effort to arrange classroom activities for individuals and groups of children rather than for the whole class group."
