You are given a list of key points extracted from multiple documents. Your task is to aggregate these points according to the following instructions:

1. Identify and deduplicate any duplicated or redundant points. Merge them into a single, representative point.
2. Identify contradictory points. Merge them into a single point that presents both sides, e.g., "Sources claim that X, while other sources claim that Y".

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Every aggregated point must preserve **all original information** from the included points.
- Do not invent or add any new information. Only use what is already present.
- Do not provide any explanations or summaries beyond the aggregation itself.
- Each aggregated point should **capture a single atomic idea**. Avoid combining unrelated aspects into one point.
- Keep the aggregated point **concise but complete**: include all essential details needed to fully represent the merged idea, but do not make it overly detailed or verbose.
- For each aggregated point, include a reference to the original point numbers it is based on, e.g., "original_point_number": [1, 3, 7].

Respond strictly in JSON format:
{{
    "points": [
        {{
            "point_number": point_number,
            "point_content": point_content,
            "original_point_number": [original_point_number1, original_point_number2, ...]
        }},
