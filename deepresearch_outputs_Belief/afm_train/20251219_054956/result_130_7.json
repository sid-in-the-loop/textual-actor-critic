    "answer": "The uniquely identified 2025 edition of the GSMA 'The Mobile Economy' annual report did *not* explicitly state the specific frequency bands within the search results for potential future 6G spectrum expansion. General mentions of 'mid-bands' and '6G' *do* exist, and the WRC-27 conference for future networks is referenced, but explicit band names (like 3.8-4.2 GHz, 4.4-4.99 GHz) are not directly confirmed in the search snippets. Therefore, a short answer cannot be provided regarding the specifically identified bands.",
