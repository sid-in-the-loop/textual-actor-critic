    "answer": "There is no universally recognized baseball player matching all these specific criteria (pitcher, 29 stolen bases in 1970, traded to Chicago White Sox in 1971 for Tommy McCraw, and a well-known \"unusual walk style nickname\"). Searches have not yielded a definitive player, with some identifying players (like Bobby Tolan, Jim Palmer, and Tommy McCraw) but none fitting all the criteria, especially the \"unusual walk style nickname\" and the timing of the trade for McCraw. The unique character of the nickname makes direct identification difficult.",
