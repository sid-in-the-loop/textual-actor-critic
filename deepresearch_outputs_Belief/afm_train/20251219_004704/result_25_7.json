    "answer": "The specific subject categorization system in Web of Science, under main categories like Science and Technology, Social Sciences, and Arts and Humanities, defines each subject category uniquely and sub-categorizes within them. For instance, \"Science\" sub-categorizes into \"Agricultural Sciences,\" \"Biological Sciences,\" \"Chemical Sciences,\" \"Geosciences,\" and \"Physical Sciences.\" Another example is \"Engineering\" encompassing \"Civil Engineering,\" \"Mechanical Engineering,\" and \"Computer Sciences/Software Engineering,\" with \"Engineering Sciences\" itself being a major category.",
