Primary source documentation and support pages provide general category examples and overarching categorization frameworks (\"Science, Technology, Social Sciences, and Arts and Humanities\") but do not offer a unified, granular naming convention for all subject categories in a structured, browsable Tables or accessible via search queries. Web of Science documentation primarily uses the public, descriptive naming convention.",
