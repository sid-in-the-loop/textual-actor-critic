    "answer": "The specified article from January 31, 2025, titled \"9 Performance Marketing Trends To Watch In 2025,\" mentions \"Increased Focus On First-Party Data.\" While this shows that the article discussed \"first-party data,\" it does not describe the trend of \"first-party data dependency among marketers in 2024\" in a way that meets the executive's specific requirement of \"reported because of first-party data in 2024.\" The article reports \"trends in 2025\" that could have been derived from past years' marketing activities, but it doesn't specify that this trend is *directly* reported \"because\" of \"first-party data in 2024.\"\n\nThe other search results from Turn 3 that were found in the specific query, specifically from Jan 2025 or later, explicitly mention \"first-party data\" in their titles. However, none of these search results provide the critical connection that the article in question (\"9 Performance Marketing Trends To Watch In 2025\") reports on \"first-party data dependency among marketers in 2024\" as a \"trend specific to the year 2025\" according to the specific wording in the question.",
