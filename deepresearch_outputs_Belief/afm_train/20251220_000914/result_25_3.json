    "answer": "Web of Science categorizes journal records into 250+ subject categories, where each subject category corresponds to a broader \"Web of Science Core Collection Subject Category\". Examples include \"Arts & Humanities Citation Index\", \"Social Science Citation Index\", and \"Science Citation Index Expanded\". Main categories like \"Science and Technology\" or \"Social Sciences\" refer to the overarching domains the specific subject categories fall into, with individual subject categories fitting within these broad classifications. A specific one-to-one listing of every \"Web of Science Core Collection Subject Category to main category\" mapping is not publicly available as a single, consolidated document, but subject categories are assigned in the manner most typical of scientific disciplines.",
