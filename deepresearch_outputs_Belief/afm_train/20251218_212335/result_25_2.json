    "answer": "The Web of Science system uses \"Research Areas\" for categorization. Main categories include: Arts and Humanities, Social Sciences, Life and Physical Sciences (including subcategories like Biomedical, Agriculture, etc.), and Technology (including subcategories like Engineering, Computer Science, etc.). Sub-categories within these broad categories provide the specific \"subject category IDs.\" There is no single, unified \"Science and Technology\" ID mapping to \"Life and Physical Sciences\" as it encompasses various specialized fields.",
