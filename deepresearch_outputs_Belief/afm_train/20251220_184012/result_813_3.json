    "answer": "The paper describes the net charge as -2.08 at physiological pH (7.4) primarily from the Asp/Glu cluster N-terminal to the hydrophobic stretch. However, the specific shape of the net charge versus pH curve and the precise inflection points cannot be determined without accessing the full figure.",
    "ground_truth": "Sigmoidal curve with inflection points near pH 4 and pH 10.",
