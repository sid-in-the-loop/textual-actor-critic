    "answer": "The net charge vs. pH curve for the single-chain construct shows a general linear trend, crossing zero at the isoelectric point (pH 4.89), with negative charge at higher pH values and positive charge at lower pH values. Inflection points are typically at the ionizable groups' pKa values, which would be the locations where the rate of change of charge per unit pH differs.",
