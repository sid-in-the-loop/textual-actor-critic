    "answer": "Summary of search results for the specific number of contributions related to sustainable fisheries management received by Ocean Action Panel 5: The global consultation phase for Ocean Action Panels at the 2025 United Nations Ocean Conference identified Ocean Action Panel 5 as focused on \"Fostering sustainable fisheries management including supporting small-scale fishers.\" While several documents (e.g., \"Ocean Action Panel 5: Extract -Stakeholder Consultation,\" \"Fostering sustainable fisheries management including,\" and \"UN OCEANS CONFERENCE Action Panel 5\") confirm the panel's focus and some mentions of contributions, **the exact number of contributions related to sustainable fisheries management specifically** has not been found in the provided search results. The detailed PDF \"Ocean Action Panel 5: Extract -Stakeholder Consultation\" (sdgs.un.org/sites/default/files/2024-10/Ocean%20Action%20Panel%205%20Extract%20-Stakeholder%20Consultation.pdf) seems most relevant to the panel's activities, but no quantitative data on \"contributions\" is explicitly stated within accessible search results. Thus, the precise number cannot be identified from the available information.",
