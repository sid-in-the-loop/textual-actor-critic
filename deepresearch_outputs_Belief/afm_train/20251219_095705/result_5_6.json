    "answer": "` element.\n\nBut hold on, the second link `https://www.novartis.com/investors/financial-data/quarterly-results` throws a flag. It explicitly says \"Q2 2024 financial report (PDF 0.5 MB)\", \"Q1 2024 press release (PDF 0.4 MB)\", and \"Q1 2024 financial report (PDF 0.5 MB)\". This seems to be the most promising. It's structured in a list format, which aligns with the user's request for \"organized by release date and quarter\". Also, the sub-topic, \"Investors\", suggests the user will be the primary target.\n\nSo, I'm confident in saying the user can find the financial reports on this page within the `investors` section of the Novartis website. It's likely the media summary overview and gives release details, which is what the user needs!\n</think>\n<answer>Investors / Financial Data / Quarterly Results",
