    "answer": "The paper explores how climate change mitigation through emissions abatement under the SSP1&RCP2.6 scenario might influence the projected rise in global urban populations facing water scarcity by 2050, highlighting potential worsening of water scarcity in highly urbanized regions despite these measures. No explicit impact of SSP1&RCP2.6-specific mitigation on scarcity is detailed, focusing instead on the combination of urbanization and climate change exacerbating scarcity.",
