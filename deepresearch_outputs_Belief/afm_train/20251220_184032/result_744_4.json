    "answer": "The \"Guidelines for undergraduate major establishment, adjustment, and degree awarding\" published by the Chinese Ministry of Education on February 21, 2020, is not explicitly mentioned in the search results as a distinct document issued on that specific date. The closest related document was a \"Notice on Further Improving Undergraduate Programs\" published on April 18, 2024, which seems to be a later update or regulation. Therefore, a specific \"guiding document\" on February 21, 2020, might not be directly identifiable from the provided search results.",
