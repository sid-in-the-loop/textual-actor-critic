    "answer": "Rooster Teeth was founded by Burnie Burns, Matt Hullum, and Geoff Ramsey. Meg Turner's birthdate is March 12, 1987. The question asks how much older Meg Turner is than Rooster Teeth, the company. Since Rooster Teeth was founded by three people and Turner was a later co-host/employee, a direct birthdate comparison for the company itself cannot be made. The answer is inconsequential as there is no company with a single birthdate to compare.",
