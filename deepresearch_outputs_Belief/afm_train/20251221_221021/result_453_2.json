    "answer": "Lowest test MAPE values for winter wheat models were achieved by regional averages, with the specific values for each region not explicitly provided in the search results. However, the paper \"Comparative Analysis of Weather-Based Indexes and the Actuaries Climate Index\" (arXiv:2504.21143v2) reports MAPE values for GLM for each crop, model, and region in Table B2. The region with the lowest test MAPE values for winter wheat is not explicitly stated in the search results, but further analysis of Table B2 would be required to identify the specific region and its corresponding MAPE value.",
