    "answer": "Figure (c) shows that when \u03c3=5, a higher \u03c3 value necessitates a lower uniqueness threshold \u03b1 for the existence of a unique urban configuration. This implies that the stability and uniqueness of city configurations are determined by the balance between \u03c3 (urban scale) and \u03b1 (uniqueness threshold), with a higher \u03c3 requiring a more stringent \u03b1 to maintain a single, well-defined configuration.",
